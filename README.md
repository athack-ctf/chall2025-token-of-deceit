# Chall - Your Challenge Title

Exploit a JWT signature verification vulnerability to manipulate user roles and escalate privileges.

## Type

- [ ] **OFF**line
- [X] **ON**line

## Designer

- Isabella Guddemi

## Description

In this challenge, participants will need to exploit a vulnerability in the JWT authentication system to escalate their privileges. The app uses JWT tokens to authenticate users, with roles encoded in the token payload. However, due to a flaw in the signature verification process (specifically CVE-2022-23529), the app allows an attacker to tamper with the JWT token without invalidating its signature. Participants will need to exploit this flaw to modify the userâ€™s role to "admin", granting them access to privileged resources and the hidden flag.
This challenge tests participants' knowledge of JWT structure, signature verification, and privilege escalation. Participants will learn how improper token validation can lead to serious security flaws and how attackers can manipulate tokens for unauthorized access.

**IMPORTANT:** This description will **NOT** be shared with participants.

# Project Structure

## 1. HACKME.md

- **[HACKME.md](HACKME.md)**: A teaser or description of the challenge to be shared with participants (in CTFd).

## 2. Source Code

- **[source/README.md](source/README.md)**: Comprehensive instructions on how to have a running instance of your
  challenge from the source.
  If your project includes multiple subprojects, please consult us (Anis and Hugo).
- **[source/*](source/)**: Your source code.

## 3. Offline Artifacts [OPTIONAL]

> **NOTE:** This directory is optional for online challenges. However, if offline artifacts need to be provided as well, 
> they should be placed here.

- **[offline-artifacts/*](offline-artifacts/)**: All files intended to be downloaded by participants
  (e.g., a flagless version of the running binary executable of a pwn challenge).
  For large files (exceeding 100 MB), please consult us (Anis and Hugo).

## 4. Solution

- **[solution/README.md](solution/README.md)**: A detailed writeup of the working solution.
- **[solution/FLAGS.md](solution/FLAGS.md)**: A single markdown file listing all (up-to-date) flags.
- **[solution/*](solution/)**: Any additional files or code necessary for constructing a reproducible solution for the
  challenge (e.g., `PoC.py`, `requirement.txt`, etc.).

## 5. Dockerization

> **NOTE:** For deployment on @Hack's infrastructure, online challenges must be containerized.
> However, this requirement does not apply during the early stages of challenge development, so do not hesitate to start
> building your online challenge if you are unfamiliar with containerization.
> We (Anis and Hugo) will take care of it.

- **[source/Dockerfile](source/Dockerfile)**: Needed for building a containerized image of the online challenge.
- **[source/docker-compose.yml](source/docker-compose.yml)**: Needed for a configuration-free run of the online
  challenge
